First, we will study CAVI in the context of a simple model, where we will derive all the steps in the algorithm explicitly. Next, we will study Bayesian inference for the Gaussian Mixture model using variational inference and here we will focus more on the application. Finally, you will also become familiar with the Dirichlet and Wishart distributions. \n",
